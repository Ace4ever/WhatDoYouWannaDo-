# MakeUpYourMind
MakeUpYourMind is an application that will randomly generate an activity for the user after they've selected some activities they may be interested in doing.  It also allows the user to select interests from a predetermined list that they can save to their profile.

The MakeUpYourMind application uses Firebase to store the user information including the interests they have saved to their profile. Other technologies used in the application are: AngularJS, jQuery, Grunt, SASS and Bootstrap.

Built by Christina Young as a front-end capstone project at Nashville Software School.
